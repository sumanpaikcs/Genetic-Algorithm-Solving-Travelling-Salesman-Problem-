The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) isa classical combinatorial optimization problem, which is simple to state but very difficult to solve. The problem is to find the shortest tour through a set of N vertices so that each vertex is visited exactly once.In this paper we provide overview of
Genetic Algorithm Which is used for solving the travelling salesman problem.We present crossover and mutation operators, developed to tackle the Travelling Salesman Problem with Genetic Algorithms with different representations.we show the experimental results obtained with different standard examples using combination of crossover and mutation operators in relation with path representation.
